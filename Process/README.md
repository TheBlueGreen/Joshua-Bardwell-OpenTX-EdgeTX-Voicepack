## Process
Current edit flow **raw**->**normalized**->**converted**->**drag-and-drop**
- **Raw** = Split but not edited.
- **Normalized** = Volume Normalized (-14LUFs).
- **Converted** = Converted/processed to match standard OpenTX voicepack(32000/16bit). Also renamed but not changed to match OpenTX naming.
- **Drag-and-drop** = Matched file names to OpenTX/EdgeTX defaults for drag-and-drop install.

## TODO
- Get feedback/improve sound quality as needed.
- ~~Adjust filenames so they can be drag-and-dropped to OpenTX/EdgeTX SD Card.~~ (thanks IDV)
- Improve installation instruction + add images.
