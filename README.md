## Process
Current edit flow **raw**->**normalized**->**converted**
- **Raw** = Split but not edited
- **Normalized** = Volume Normalized (-14LUFs)
- **Converted** = Converted to match standard OpenTX voicepack(32000/16bit). Also renamed but not changed to match OpenTX naming.

## TODO
- Get feedback on sound quality.
- Adjust filenames so they can be drag-and-dropped to OpenTX/EdgeTX SD Card. (Initial support added, thanks IDV)
- Improve installation instruction + add images.

## How To Install

1. Backup OpenTX/EdgeTX SD Card (mount your transmitter to your PC or use a SD card reader)
2. Download contents of "drag-and-drop" folder from this GitHub repo.
3. Extract or copy contents of the "drag-and-drop" folder into the X://SOUNDS/en folder on your OpenTX/EdgeTX SD card. (Drive letter X will be different for everyone)
4. Enjoy!

## Notes and Contact Info

This repo is not directly related to Joshua Bardwell. The original uncut recording was released on the FPV Know-It-All Patreon Discord.

>I (Scincidae) decided to attempt to convert Joshua's released recording to a usuable voicepack for anyone to use. There may be other voicepacks created from the same source and they may or may not be more complete or of higher quality. I am not a audio professional, just a fan that wanted to give back to the amazing FPV community. If anyone would like to help, feel free to reach out to me.

*Contact Scincidae on the discord with any questions/concerns.*

- IDV - organizing and matching file names from the converted files to match OpenTX
