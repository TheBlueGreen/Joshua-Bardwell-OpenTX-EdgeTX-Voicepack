## Process
Current edit flow **Raw**->**Normalized**->**Converted**->**Renamed**
- **Raw** = Split but not edited.
- **Normalized** = Volume Normalized (-14LUFs).
- **Converted** = Converted/processed to match standard OpenTX voicepack(32000/16bit). Also renamed but not changed to match OpenTX naming.
- **Renamed** = Matched file names to OpenTX/EdgeTX defaults for drag-and-drop install. These files stay here until a new release is out
