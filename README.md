## How To Install

1. Backup OpenTX/EdgeTX SD card (mount your transmitter to your PC or use a SD card reader)
2. Download release version of the Joshua Bardwell OpenTX Voicepack here: https://github.com/TheBlueGreen/Joshua-Bardwell-OpenTX-EdgeTX-Voicepack/releases/tag/1.0.0
3. Extract or copy contents of the "drag-and-drop" folder into the X://SOUNDS/en folder on your OpenTX/EdgeTX SD card. (Drive letter X will be different for everyone)
4. Enjoy!

>You may also install the drag-and-drop-extended folder which includes extra sounds that are not assigned to any event in the default OpenTX/EdgeTX configuration. To use them you must asign them to a custom event. All files were shortened to 8 characters or less, which is a restriction of OpenTX/EdgeTX. A readme file is included with full sound descriptions.
>
> For model independent sounds you would use GLOBAL FUNCTIONS.
> 
> For model dependent sounds you would use SPECIAL FUNCTIONS.
>
> To find out more please see: https://doc.open-tx.org/manual-for-opentx-2-2/advanced-features/audio

## Process
Current edit flow **raw**->**normalized**->**converted**->**drag-and-drop**
- **Raw** = Split but not edited.
- **Normalized** = Volume Normalized (-14LUFs).
- **Converted** = Converted/processed to match standard OpenTX voicepack(32000/16bit). Also renamed but not changed to match OpenTX naming.
- **Drag-and-drop** = Matched file names to OpenTX/EdgeTX defaults for drag-and-drop install.

## TODO
- Get feedback/improve sound quality as needed.
- ~~Adjust filenames so they can be drag-and-dropped to OpenTX/EdgeTX SD Card.~~ (thanks IDV)
- Improve installation instruction + add images.

## Notes and Contact Info

This repo is not directly related to Joshua Bardwell. The original uncut recording was released on the FPV Know-It-All Patreon Discord.

>I (Scincidae) decided to attempt to convert Joshua's released recording to a usuable voicepack for anyone to use. There may be other voicepacks created from the same source and they may or may not be more complete or of higher quality. I am not a audio professional, just a fan that wanted to give back to the amazing FPV community. If anyone would like to help, feel free to reach out to me.

*Contact Scincidae on the discord with any questions/concerns.*

## Credits
- *Joshua Bardwell* - for the voice recordings of course!
- Scincidae (Me) - slicing/editing raw recordings, managing GitHub repo.
- IDV - organizing and matching file names from the converted files to match OpenTX, shortened extended sounds/wrote their descriptions.
